# Examples

This directory holds example audio files which are also used by the audio analyzer library's automated tests. They will be generated automatically, if absent, during testing, or can be generated manually by running `generate.py` as a stand-alone script.

## Usage

Since these files are generated with known imperfections, they generally should not be used for audio device testing. However, you can use them to informally
test the audio analyzer library's performance by running "python analyze.py examples/*.wav" from the parent directory.

## File Descriptions

The following audio files are generated by `generate.py`. Notes:
- Each file is five seconds long with one second of trailing silence.
- They have a peak amplitude of 0.8. Note that this is _VERY_ loud when played back through an audio system, so be very careful to play them at a low volume if you listen to them.
- They are two-channel (stereo) and have a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `example_tone_1k-0-000-pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave with 0% THD (pure tone). Baseline for distortion testing. |
| `example_tone_1k-0-001-pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave with 0.001% THD. Tests low-distortion measurement capability. |
| `example_tone_1k-0-010-pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave with 0.01% THD. Tests mid-range distortion detection. |
| `example_tone_1k-1-000-pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave with 1.0% THD. Tests higher distortion levels. |
| `example_noise-floor.wav` | Low-level white noise (-80 dBFS, 5 seconds). For noise floor analysis. |
| `example_tone_noisy.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave (5 seconds) with added noise. |
| `example_filt-sweep.wav` | Logarithmic frequency sweep 20 Hz–20 kHz (5 seconds) post-filtered with a 300 Hz - 3000 Hz bandpass filter. Tests filter response. |
| `example_filt-noise.wav` | White noise (5 seconds) post-filtered with a 300 Hz - 3000 Hz bandpass filter. |
