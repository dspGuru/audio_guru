This directory holds example audio test files which are also used by the
automated tests. They will be generated automatically, if absent, during
testing, or can be generated manually by running generate.py as a stand-alone
script.

These files also can be used for audio device testing, for example, by burning
them onto a CD, playing them with a CD player, and capturing the resulting audio
via a computer sound card for later analysis of the player's performance by
analyzing them via analyze.py.
