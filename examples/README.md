# Examples

This directory holds example audio test files which are also used by the automated tests. They will be generated automatically, if absent, during testing, or can be generated manually by running `generate.py` as a stand-alone script.

## Usage

These files also can be used for audio device testing, for example, by burning them onto a CD, playing them with a CD player, and capturing the resulting audio via a computer sound card for later analysis of the player's performance by analyzing them via `analyze.py`.
## File Descriptions

The following audio files are generated by `generate.py`:

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `test_tone_1k-X_XXX_pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine waves with specific Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) levels (0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 1.0%). Useful for testing distortion measurements. |
| `test_noise.wav` | White noise audio (5 seconds) followed by 1 second of silence. Useful for noise floor analysis. |
| `test_tone_X.wav` | Pure sine wave tones at various frequencies (100 Hz, 400 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz). |
| `test_60_7k.wav` | Two-tone signal combining 60 Hz and 7 kHz (amplitude ratio 4:1). Commonly used for SMPTE Intermodulation Distortion (IMD) testing. |
| `test_19k_20k.wav` | Two-tone signal combining 19 kHz and 20 kHz (1:1 amplitude ratio). Commonly used for CCIF Intermodulation Distortion (IMD) testing. |
| `test_sweep.wav` | logarithmic frequency sweep from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (10 seconds). Useful for frequency response analysis. |
