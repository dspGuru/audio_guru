# Signals

This directory holds basic signal files used for testing and calibration. They will be generated automatically, if absent, during testing, or can be generated manually by running `generate.py` as a stand-alone script.

## File Descriptions

The following audio files are generated by `generate.py`. Notes:
- All files are five seconds long with one second of trailing silence.
- They have a peak amplitude of 0.8. Note that this is _VERY_ loud when played back through an audio system, so be very careful to play them at a low volume if you listen to them.
- They have a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz and two channels (stereo).
- For tones and sweeps, the second (right) channel is in quadrature with the first (left) channel.
