# Examples

This directory holds example audio test files which are also used by the automated tests. They will be generated automatically, if absent, during testing, or can be generated manually by running `generate.py` as a stand-alone script.

## Usage

These files also can be used for audio device testing, for example, by burning them onto a CD, playing them with a CD player, and capturing the resulting audio via a computer sound card for later analysis of the player's performance by analyzing them via `analyze.py`.
## File Descriptions

The following audio files are generated by `generate.py`:

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `test_tone_1k-0-000-pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave with 0% THD (pure tone). Baseline for distortion testing. |
| `test_tone_1k-0-001-pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave with 0.001% THD. Tests low-distortion measurement capability. |
| `test_tone_1k-0-010-pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave with 0.01% THD. Tests mid-range distortion detection. |
| `test_tone_1k-1-000-pct.wav` | 1 kHz sine wave with 1.0% THD. Tests higher distortion levels. |
| `test_noise.wav` | White noise (5 seconds) followed by silence. For noise floor analysis. |
| `test_tone_20.wav` | Pure 20 Hz sine wave. |
| `test_tone_100.wav` | Pure 100 Hz sine wave. |
| `test_tone_250.wav` | Pure 250 Hz sine wave. |
| `test_tone_400.wav` | Pure 400 Hz sine wave. |
| `test_tone_1k.wav` | Pure 1 kHz sine wave. |
| `test_tone_10k.wav` | Pure 10 kHz sine wave. |
| `test_tone_20k.wav` | Pure 20 kHz sine wave. |
| `test_tones_60_7k.wav` | Two-tone: 60 Hz and 7 kHz (4:1 amplitude ratio). SMPTE IMD test. |
| `test_tones_19k_20k.wav` | Two-tone: 19 kHz and 20 kHz (1:1 amplitude ratio). CCIF IMD test. |
| `test_sweep.wav` | Logarithmic frequency sweep 20 Hz–20 kHz (10 seconds). Frequency response analysis. |
| `test_filt-sweep.wav` | Logarithmic frequency sweep 20 Hz–20 kHz (10 seconds) post-filtered with a 300 Hz - 3000 Hz bandpass filter. Tests filter response and passband characteristics. |
| `test_filt-noise.wav` | White noise (5 seconds) post-filtered with a 300 Hz - 3000 Hz bandpass filter. Tests passband spectral energy vs stopbands. |
