Audio device test utilities

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Scripts

### analyze.py
Analyzes audio files matching a specified pattern. It provides detailed statistics and can display signal components and noise floor information.

**Usage:**
```bash
python analyze.py [options] <pattern>
```

### generate.py
Generates a set of example audio files (sine waves, noise, sweeps, distortion tests, etc.) in the `examples/` directory.

**Usage:**
```bash
python generate.py
```

### join.py
Joins multiple audio files into a single continuous file. You can specify a duration of silence to insert between each file.

**Usage:**
```bash
python join.py -w <output_file> [-s <silence_seconds>] <input_files>
```

### split.py
Splits audio files into separate segments (typically based on silence) and saves them as individual files.

**Usage:**
```bash
python split.py [options] <pattern>
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains various audio test files used for automated testing and device verification. These files can be generated using `generate.py`.

Examples include:
- **Tones**: Pure sine waves at various frequencies and THD levels for distortion testing.
- **Noise**: White noise for noise floor analysis.
- **Two-Tone Signals**: Combinations like 60 Hz/7 kHz (SMPTE IMD) and 19 kHz/20 kHz (CCIF IMD).
- **Sweep**: Logarithmic frequency sweep (20 Hz - 20 kHz) for frequency response analysis.

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for more details.

## File Naming Conventions

The project uses consistent naming conventions for audio files, particularly in the `examples/` and `samples/` directories, to identify the source, signal type, and parameters.

### Generated Examples (`examples/`)
Files generated by `generate.py` typically follow the pattern:
`test_<type>_<frequency>[_<extra>].wav`

- **Type**: `tone`, `noise`, `sweep`, `19k_20k` (IMD test), etc.
- **Frequency**: e.g., `1k` (1 kHz), `100` (100 Hz).
- **Extra**: Optional parameters like THD percentage (e.g., `0_001_pct` for 0.001%).

**Examples:**
- `test_tone_1k.wav`: 1 kHz sine wave.
- `test_sweep.wav`: Frequency sweep.
- `test_19k_20k.wav`: Two-tone signal (19 kHz + 20 kHz).

### Device Samples (`samples/`)
Recordings from devices often follow the pattern:
`<Device>_<SignalType>_<Frequency>.wav` or `<Source>_to_<Destination>_<Signal>.wav`

- **Device**: Name of the device under test (e.g., `Denon_DVD-1720`, `Yamaha_CDC-645`).
- **Signal/Frequency**: `1k`, `sweep`, `19k_20k`, etc.
- **Signal Chain**: Indicates connections (e.g., `Sony_VPP_to_xfi`).

**Examples:**
- `Denon_DCD-700_1k.wav`: 1 kHz tone played by a Denon DCD-700.
- `Sony_VPP_to_xfi_1kHz.wav`: 1 kHz tone from Sony VPP captured by X-Fi.
